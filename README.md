Overview
========
Working through guava http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.guava

Note on gradle
==============
The build scripts are built around gradle.  You can install gradle or use the provided version.  

To install using [brew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), run `brew install gradle`.

To install manually, goto [gradle](http://www.gradle.org/downloads).

To use the provided version, instead of running `gradle`, run `./g`

Opening in Eclipse
==================
If you use Eclipse, the gradle scripts are nice enough to create your project and classpath files.

The first time you open the project, first create the eclipse project files:

```
gradle eclipse
```

Now you can import the project into eclipse.

If you change dependencies, update the classpath:

```
gradle cleanEclipseClasspath eclipseClasspath
```
